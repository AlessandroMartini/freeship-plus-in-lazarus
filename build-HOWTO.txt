To build FreeShip from sources you will need Lazarus 2.0.* FPC 3.0.4 

Use project options FreeShip.lpi 
Adjust Config and  Target to Gtk2 or win32 and and to your OS environment.
Unselect "Win32 gui application" because for time being some output goes to console 

You do not need Qt4 anymore.

In Windows you need git for Windows. Please set it to upload texts in Unix style.
Also you need: 
- Cygwin with following packages: sed,grep,binutils,file,cut,git,zip,imagemagic
- MinGW32 to build FreeShip
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll

copy these libraries into project root

If you want to package installation package you should run release.sh
Some prerequisites have to be fulfilled first: 
 - build versinfo utility. Build Utils/versinfo.lpi
 - release.sh and zipbin.sh are Bash scripts that call some non-windows utils: md5sum, grep, sed, file, cut, zip.
   In Linux you usually already have them out of box. If not, please install.
   In Windows you need to install something like Cygwin, as it mentioned above, or Msys2.
   Good recent news: In Windows 10 these binaries can be installed natively (from Ubuntu) and you can use Bash as command line.

Good luck!
