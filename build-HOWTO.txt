To build FreeShip from sources you will need Lazarus 1.6.* FPC 3.0. 
Install package FreeShip into Lazarus.

In project FreeShip.lpi you have to set project target to qt (if not set) and to your OS environment.

Note: Due to absense of reliable Qt4 dlls only 32-bit Lazarus is currently supported for Windows platform.
You may try to build 64-bit FreeShip, if you have Qt4 64-bit dlls.

In Windows you need git for Windows. Please set it to upload texts in Unix style.
Also you need: 
- Cygwin with following packages: sed,grep,binutils,file,cut,git,zip,imagemagic
- MinGW32 to build FreeShip
- Qt4-opensource-mingw for following dependency libraries:
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
QtCore4.dll
QtGui4.dll
QtNetwork4.dll
QtWebKit4.dll

copy these libraries into project root

You need Qt4Pas5 libraries to run FreeShip.
In WIndows: Qt4Pas5.dll

If you have Lazarus 1.6.0, 1.6.1, you will need to fix bug 0029978 of LCL for QT by applying following patch:
http://bugs.freepascal.org/ bug ID:0029978
Patch: http://svn.freepascal.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/lcl/interfaces/qt/qtwidgets.pas?root=lazarus&r1=52054&r2=52148&pathrev=52148

I you want to package installation package you should run release.sh
Some prerequisites have to be fulfilled first: 
 - build versinfo utility. Build Utils/versinfo.lpi
 - release.sh and zipbin.sh are Bash scripts that call some non-windows utils: md5sum, grep, sed, file, cut, zip.
   In Linux you usually already have them out of box. If not, please install.
   In Windows you need to install something like Cygwin, as it mentioned above, or Msys2.
   Good recent news: In Windows 10 these binaries can be installed natively (from Ubuntu) and you can use Bash as command line.

Good luck!
